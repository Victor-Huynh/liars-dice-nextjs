# Liar's Dice by Victor Huynh 
This is a project that I will be working in order to learn the capabilities of the following tools:
- NextJS 13
- React 18
- TypeScript in React
- Tailwind CSS 3
- Socket IO
- Jest

I have no industry experience with these tools as of the start of this developement on February 2023
This is also my 5th time restarting this app... so hopefully this is the one

## Liar's Dice is a classic bluffing game that is popular during karaoke sessions in Asian culture, as well as a drinking game
I have found to be one of the more interesting games since it doesn't rely on pure luck - this is a game that tests your trust between the ones close to you, as well as giving opportunity to make fun and memorable rounds (as well as targeting in some ways)
### In addition to the classic ruleset, you can tweak the game as appropriately via house rules, making it a flexible game!
There are many ways to play and I will hopefully introduce and cater to each one!
It varies from culture to culture, household to household
